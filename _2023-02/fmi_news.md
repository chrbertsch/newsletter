#### Maintenance release FMI 3.0.1

The FMI project has published a maintenance release FMI 2.0.3 with bugfixes and clarifications, see [here](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard/releases/)

#### FMI Compatibility Information

The [FMI tools page](https://fmi-standard.org/tools/) now provides additional information on how the tool vendors have tested their FMU import and export capabilities and standard compliance with other tools. Exporting tools also provide example FMUs, that can be tested by other importing tools. This information is provided on an external webpage or repository provided by the tool vendors themselves.

Tool vendors that provide this information will be marked with a yellow star and are listed onthe top of the list.

(This replaces the [FMI Cross Check](https://fmi-standard.org/tools/), which was very successful to improve the maturity of FMI supporting tools, but exploded in complexity due to the number of participating tools)
