#### FMI Compatibility Information

The [FMI tools page](https://fmi-standard.org/tools/) now provides additional information on how the tool vendors have tested their FMU import and export capabilities and standard compliance with other tools. Exporting tools also provide example FMUs, that can be tested by other importing tools. This information is provided on an external webpage or repository provided by the tool vendors themselves.

Tool vendors that provide this information will be marked with a yellow star and are listed onthe top of the list.
