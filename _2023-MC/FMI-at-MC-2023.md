#### Talk on Layerd standards to FMI

Members of the FMI project will present the concept of layered standards to the FMI standard.

The FMI standard - just like any other standard - faces the challenge of balancing generality with enabling specific use cases. 
Including every domain or use-case specific extension in the core standard would significantly increase its length, making it unreadable and unimplementable. 
To allow for extensions of the core standard for specific use cases, the Modelica Association developed the concept of layered standards, first in the SSP standard and later in FMI.

Layered standards to the FMI Standard can be defined by any organization, not just the FMI project.
But the FMI project itself is currently working on various layered standards
* for XCP support of FMUs (FMI-LS-XCP) https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-xcp
* for the simulation of network communication with FMI (FMI-LS-BUS) https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-bus
* for the representation of regular maps with FMI 3.0 arrays and the structuring of parameters (FMI-LS-STRUCT) https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-struct


#### FMI User meeting
